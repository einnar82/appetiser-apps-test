# Appetiser Apps Coding Challenge

**Problem:**

Create a simple web app, using Laravel, that can add events ( no need for edit and delete ) to a calendar as shown in the [video](http://178.128.212.62/). Save the event to a MySQL table. The app needs to be on a single page. You may use any javascript framework and css framework.

When done, push your codes to a Github repository and send us the link. Pull and setup the code to an online server. If you do not have an online server, we can provide you with one.

**Solution:**
