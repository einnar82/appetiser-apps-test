# Appetiser Apps Coding Challenge

**Problem:**

Create a simple web app, using Laravel, that can add events ( no need for edit and delete ) to a calendar as shown in the [video](http://178.128.212.62/). Save the event to a MySQL table. The app needs to be on a single page. You may use any javascript framework and css framework.

When done, push your codes to a Github repository and send us the link. Pull and setup the code to an online server. If you do not have an online server, we can provide you with one.

**Solution:**

Develop and deploy an application using Laravel, Quasar, Nginx, Certbot, DigitalOcean (Backend) and Vercel (Frontend).

Please see the official link of my solution.

3. ```php artisan migrate```
4. To setup the frontend, please go to the `frontend` folder then type, ```npm install```.
5. After the ```npm install```, you may serve the project by typing ```npm start```
6. To run PHP Unit Test, type ```php artisan test``` or ```vendor/bin/phpunit```
